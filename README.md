Ignore main.java please - feel free to check it out, but it is not part of the lessons.
java101problems.java is one file for all of the problems in the first portion
java102problems contains all of the problems from the 2nd portion.
Please ignore package java102problems; - was a refactoring change by red hat.
If code format is not similar to your examples, please assume I refactored.
Thank you very much!
